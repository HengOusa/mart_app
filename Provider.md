# 🚀 MASTER PROMPT: Learn Provider State Management in Flutter — Beginner to Expert

You are my **Senior Flutter Architect, State Management Expert, and Professional Flutter Instructor** with 10+ years of experience building production-grade Flutter mobile applications.

Your job is to teach me **Provider State Management in Flutter from absolute beginner level to advanced/expert level**.

I want to become capable of designing, implementing, debugging, testing, optimizing, and architecting real-world Flutter applications using Provider professionally.

---

## 🎯 My Learning Goal

Teach me:

**Dart Fundamentals → Flutter Fundamentals → State Management Fundamentals → Provider Beginner → Provider Intermediate → Provider Advanced → Provider Architecture → Production Applications → Performance Optimization → Testing → Expert-Level Architecture**

Do not simply give me definitions.

I want to **understand why Provider works, how it works internally, when to use it, when NOT to use it, and how professional Flutter developers structure Provider-based applications.**

---

# 📚 PHASE 0 — Prerequisites

Before teaching Provider, verify that I understand:

### Dart

* Variables
* Data types
* `final` and `const`

* Inheritance
* Abstract classes
* Interfaces
* Mixins
* Generics
* Collections
* Null safety
* `Future`
* `async` / `await`
* Streams

# 🟢 PHASE 1 — Understanding State

Teach me:

1. What is state?
2. What is UI state?
3. What is application state?
4. What is local state?
5. What is shared state?
6. Why does Flutter need state management?
7. Problems with excessive `setState()`
8. Prop drilling
9. Rebuilding widgets
10. State ownership
11. State lifecycle

Use simple Flutter examples.

---

# 🟢 PHASE 2 — Understanding Provider

Teach me:

* What is Provider?
* Why was Provider created?
* What problem does Provider solve?
* How Provider works conceptually
* Provider and Flutter's widget tree
* `InheritedWidget`
* `ChangeNotifier`
* `notifyListeners()`
* Dependency injection
* Dependency lookup
* Reactive UI updates

Explain the relationship:

```text
Flutter Widget Tree
        ↓
InheritedWidget
        ↓
Provider
        ↓
ChangeNotifier
        ↓
notifyListeners()
        ↓
UI rebuild
```

Explain every part clearly.

---

# 🟢 PHASE 3 — Provider Fundamentals

Teach me step-by-step:

### Basic Provider

```dart
Provider<T>
```

Explain:

* Creating a Provider
* Providing an object
* Reading a Provider
* Accessing dependencies
* `context.read<T>()`
* `context.watch<T>()`
* `context.select<T>()`

Explain exactly when each should be used.

---

# 🟢 PHASE 4 — ChangeNotifier

Teach me deeply:

```dart
class CounterProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  int _count = 0;

  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

Explain:

* Private state
* Getters
* Methods
* `notifyListeners()`
* Listener registration
* UI rebuilding
* Encapsulation
* Why state should usually not be publicly mutable

Then show professional implementations.

---

# 🟢 PHASE 5 — ChangeNotifierProvider

Teach:

```dart
ChangeNotifierProvider
```

Cover:

* Creating providers
* Providing existing objects
* Creating objects
* Disposal
* Provider lifecycle
* `create`
* `value`
* Common mistakes
* Provider ownership

Explain why blindly using:

```dart
ChangeNotifierProvider.value()
```

can be problematic.

---

# 🟢 PHASE 6 — Reading Provider Data

Teach all approaches:

### `context.read`

```dart
context.read<CounterProvider>()
```

### `context.watch`

```dart
context.watch<CounterProvider>()
```

### `context.select`

```dart
context.select<CounterProvider, int>(
  (provider) => provider.count,
)
```

### Consumer

```dart
Consumer<CounterProvider>(
  builder: (context, provider, child) {
    return Text('${provider.count}');
  },
)
```

### Selector

```dart
Selector<CounterProvider, int>(
  selector: (_, provider) => provider.count,
  builder: (_, count, __) {
    return Text('$count');
  },
)
```

Explain:

* How they work

      create: (_) => CartProvider(),
    ),

```

Explain how they communicate without creating tightly coupled code.

---

# 🟠 PHASE 16 — Provider Performance Optimization

Error
```

Explain immutable state models and state transitions.
